## Books I Like

- **The Jakarta Method by Vincent Bevins:** delves into Washington's rabid anti-communism crusade in Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Guatemala, and around the world, showing how that brutal Cold War policy of state-sanctioned mass murder has shaped our current world order
- **Hard Damage by Aria Arber:** beautiful unapologetically political poetry!!
- **I-Hotel by Karen Tei Yamashita:** experimental, ambitious, a sprawling tome that touches upon the history of Asian American Bay Area activism and its connections to the internationalist socialist/communist politics of the 70s
- **Blood in My Eye by George Jackson:** a collection of letters and essays by the black revolutionary before he was killed in an alleged prison escape attempt. His essays on fascism are especially illuminating
- **Uzumaki by Junji Ito:** a classic for all horror manga lovers!!
- **Sweet Home by Carnby Kim:** great manhwa that explores the monstrous edge of desire with lots of body horror (would not recommend the live-action remake)
