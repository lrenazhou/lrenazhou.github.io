## Books I Like

- **I'm Waiting For You by Kim Bo-young:** a speculative short story collection that blew my mind with its inventiveness. Time travel, fallen gods, love that transcends time and place, it has it all! 
- **Broken Stars by various authors:** an anthology of Chinese Sci-Fi translated into English by the Hugo Award-winning Ken Liu
- **The Jakarta Method by Vincent Bevins:** delves into Washington's rabid anti-communism crusade in Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Guatemala, and around the world, showing how that brutal Cold War policy of state-sanctioned mass murder has shaped our current world order
- **I-Hotel by Karen Tei Yamashita:** experimental, ambitious, a sprawling tome that touches upon the history of Asian American Bay Area activism and its connections to the internationalist socialist/communist politics of the 70s
- **Blood in My Eye by George Jackson:** a collection of letters and essays by the black revolutionary before he was killed in an alleged prison escape attempt in 1971. His essays on fascism are especially illuminating
