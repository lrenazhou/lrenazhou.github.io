<h2>Books I like:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>The Jarkta Method</b> by Vincent Bevins: a must-read for any socialist living in the imperial core to understand the extent of Washington's anti-communist crusade in the 1970s, and its effects today</li>
  <li><b>Hard Damage</b> by Aria Arber: beautiful unapologetically political poetry!!</li>
  <li><b>I-Hotel</b> by Karen Tei Yamashita: a tome that explores the history of Asian American activism in the Bay Area, the Save-the-I-Hotel movement, grounded in the internationalist socialist/communist politics of the 70s, experimental, ambitious, and demands to be read again and again</li>
  <li><b>Blood in my Eye</b> by George Jackson: a collection of letters and essays by the black revolutionary before he was killed by San Quentin prison guards in an alleged prison escape in August 21, 1971. His essays on fascism are especially illuminating</li>
